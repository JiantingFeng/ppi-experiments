# ppi-experiments
Experiments for ppi and related methods

## Setup

### Data Generation

- `n`: number of labeled data (default 1000)
- `m`: number of unlabeled data (no default value, varing from 500 to 3000)
- `p`: number of features (default 10)
- `sigma`: variance of noise (default 1)

We denote the true parameter as $\beta$, and the first three elements of $\beta$ is $0, 0.05, 0.10$
